# Make your font (.png)
    Evenly space your letters (as if they fit in a grid)
    Transparent background by preference (to allow superpositions)

# Create a text file (.txt) of the same name as your font
    Containing the letters that are used in your image
    In the order they are used (including newlines)
    
See included examples for handling accents etc.

Your font will now appear in the droplist of the Pixel Font Viewer


# Tricks:
The options you change in the program (spacing etc.) will appear here as a .ini
If you want your font to be handled as a monospace, fixed-width font, put "mono" somewhere in the file name.
If you are still unhappy whith how a character was cropped, an editable .json containing the position of all the characters will be automatically generated the first time you use a font.
