Make your font (.png, .bmp, .gif)
    Evently space your letters (as if they fit in a grid)
    Transparent background by preference (if two letters supperpose)

Create a text file (.txt) of the same name of your font
    Containing the letters that are used in your image
    In the order they are used (including newlines)

See included example.

Drag your font image onto font_to_data.exe 
    To generate a .json describing the position of each letter
    Your font will now appear in the droplist of the Pixel Font Visualizer

The options you change in the program (spacing etc.) will appear here as a .ini
