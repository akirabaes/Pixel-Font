•[toggle]force monospace
    use hsep to fix (alignment? centered so far)
    size is median. If max allow negative hsep?

•find an idea to make window size easier to manage

•accents: missing accents: ignore, convert to plain, simulate by combining
    ignore: current option: missing character is not used
    convert: missing é is turned into e
        IDEA: maybe editable tables of convertable characters to try (for example - an longer -)
    combine: only for accents, surimpose ^ with e. Results not guaranteed. Intelligent shift for caps? (fit the lowest pixel to the highest pixel) Center.
    
    
•Current replacement for chars is not consistent with the wrapping algorithm
get_char_image should be going trough the replacements itself 
get_char_width should call get_chat_image instead of diretly going for the data
  
Manually replace:
«»  by " and " (since unidecode turn them into << and >>)
