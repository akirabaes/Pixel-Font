•[toggle]force monospace
    use hsep to fix (alignment? centered so far)
    size is median. If max allow negative hsep?

•find an idea to make window size easier to manage

•Current replacement for chars is not consistent with the wrapping algorithm
    get_char_image should be going trough the replacements itself 
    get_char_width should call get_chat_image instead of diretly going for the data
•Current accents is not consistent with size
  
•maybe editable tables of convertable characters to try

        - and longer -
        «»  by " and " (since unidecode turn them into << and >>)?

•Separate general options (current font, outline) from font-based options

•add the missing options in the GUI and the .ini (two bools and an int)
